# Comfy Chair Improvement Roadmap

## Overview

This roadmap outlines strategic improvements to enhance Comfy Chair's usability, maintainability, and feature set. The plan is organized into four phases, prioritizing foundational improvements before adding advanced features.

## Current State Analysis

- **Codebase**: 2368 lines in main.go, well-structured but needs continued refactoring
- **Features**: Strong node management, environment handling, live reload capabilities
- **Pain Points**: No testing, some unused code, could benefit from enhanced UX
- **Opportunities**: Performance monitoring, better templates, developer tools

## Phase 1: Code Quality & Foundation üèóÔ∏è
**Timeline**: 1-2 weeks  
**Priority**: High  
**Branch**: `feature/phase1-code-quality`

### Goals
- Establish solid foundation for future development
- Improve code maintainability and reliability
- Add testing infrastructure

### Tasks

#### Code Cleanup
- [ ] Remove 7 unused functions identified by linter
  - `saveComfyUIPathToEnv`, `checkVenvPython`
  - Process cache methods (`cleanupStaleEntries`, `getCachedStatus`, `updateCache`)
  - `isProcessRunningReal`
- [ ] Fix linter suggestion: use tagged switch on action (line 444)
- [ ] Continue main.go refactoring (extract 200-300 more lines)

#### Testing Infrastructure
- [ ] Set up Go testing framework and CI
- [ ] Add unit tests for core functions:
  - Environment detection (`GetActiveComfyInstall`)
  - Configuration loading/validation
  - Node creation and templating
  - Process management functions
- [ ] Add integration tests for critical workflows
- [ ] Set up test coverage reporting

#### Basic Enhancements
- [ ] Add `--version` flag with build info (git hash, build date)
- [ ] Improve error messages with actionable suggestions
- [ ] Add structured logging with configurable levels
- [ ] Add shell completion (bash, zsh, fish)

### Acceptance Criteria
- All linter warnings resolved
- Test coverage > 60% for core packages
- Main.go reduced to < 2000 lines
- Version information available via CLI
- Clean build with no warnings

## Phase 2: Enhanced User Experience üéØ
**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks  
**Priority**: High  
**Branch**: `feature/phase2-user-experience`

### Goals
- Streamline first-time user experience
- Improve configuration management
- Add validation and health checking

### Tasks

#### Configuration Management
- [ ] Interactive configuration wizard for first-time setup
- [ ] Configuration validation command (`comfy-chair validate`)
- [ ] Environment health checks with repair suggestions
- [ ] Configuration profiles (dev, staging, production)
- [ ] Auto-migration of legacy configurations

#### User Experience Improvements  
- [ ] Improved error messages with solution links
- [ ] Progress indicators for long-running operations
- [ ] Better help system with examples (`comfy-chair examples <command>`)
- [ ] Interactive troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Confirmation prompts for destructive operations

#### Documentation & Help
- [ ] Built-in command examples and tutorials
- [ ] Common issues troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Interactive setup walkthrough
- [ ] Better CLI help formatting

### Acceptance Criteria
- First-time users can set up without external documentation
- All configuration issues have clear resolution paths
- Validation command catches and explains common problems
- Help system provides actionable guidance

### Tasks

#### Performance & Monitoring
- [ ] ComfyUI performance metrics (startup time, memory usage)
- [ ] Resource monitoring (GPU/CPU usage tracking)
- [ ] Performance history and trending
- [ ] Bottleneck identification and suggestions

#### Enhanced Node Management
- [ ] Multiple node scaffolding templates:
  - Basic node template (current)
  - Advanced node with web UI components
  - API-focused node template
  - Model loading node template
- [ ] Node dependency conflict detection
- [ ] Node marketplace integration (browse popular nodes)
- [ ] Node update notifications
- [ ] Batch node operations

#### Health & Diagnostics
- [ ] Automated system health checks
- [ ] ComfyUI log analysis and parsing
- [ ] Error pattern detection and alerting
- [ ] Environment consistency validation
- [ ] Dependency audit and security scanning

### Acceptance Criteria
- Performance metrics available via CLI
- At least 3 node templates available
- Health checks catch common issues automatically
- Node management supports batch operations

- Tag releases at the end of each phase

### Documentation Updates
- Update CLAUDE.md with new development patterns
- Keep README.md current with new features
- Document breaking changes and migration paths
- Maintain changelog for each release

### Quality Gates
- All tests must pass before merging
- Code coverage maintained or improved
- Documentation updated for user-facing changes
- Performance regressions identified and addressed

This roadmap balances immediate improvements with long-term strategic enhancements, ensuring Comfy Chair remains maintainable while adding valuable features for users and developers.
